This is a simple tool I created to estimate tap test results from pdf scans.
(Seeing that we like to work remotely...)

How to use:
1. Open taptest.html with a browser (Chrome, Edge or Firefox should work).
2. Open a pdf file by clicking "Choose File" or "Browse" button.
3. Go to the required page by clicking "Previous" or "Next" buttons.
4. Select an envelope from the drop-down list.
5. Click "Tap Left" or "Tap Right" button as needed.

Notes:
1. The assumptions are that the scan is 1 page.
2. The results are rather approximate, mainly because:
- our scanner is not perfect at aligning pages;
- envelopes are not manufactured with great accuracy
  (there ARE deviations in size, form, locations of windows).
 But they seem to be useful in general, and notable issues should be visible.
3. New envelopes can be added; I may be doing this from time to time as needed.
 The procedure is not too difficult, and involves making a scan of the envelope,
  running addenvelope.html on it and manually adding the resulting line of code to envelopes.js file.

History:
v1. Initial attempt.
v2. Added ruler (inches) and OMR codes.
    Envelopes can have different sizes now,
      and the app calculates how many times the paper is folded.
v3. The ruler is improved and measuring can snap to 1/16th of inches.
    Added tolerance ruler for the barcode inside the address window.
    Envelope data format is changed to be based on inches, so parameters of
      an envelope can be manually adjusted in the envelope.js file (if they are known);
      description / comments can be added.
    Theoretically, paper can be any size now (just the orientation must
      match that of the envelope).
    Updated to work with the latest pdf.js library and included it with the tool.

Enjoy!
